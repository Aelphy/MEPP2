**MEPP website is [available here](http://liris.cnrs.fr/mepp/)**.


MEPP is a C++, cross-platform, software development
kit (SDK) for **processing and visualizing 3D surface
meshes and point clouds**. It provides both an application programming
interface (API) for creating new processing filters and a
graphical user interface (GUI) that can be used directly
and integrate new filters as plugins.

It allows to **process and visualize both static (and
dynamic) 3D surface meshes, with color attributes,
texture informations and normals** or **point clouds with color attributes and normals**.
It is intended for engineers, researchers, but also for
students thanks to a simple use, facilitated by the
proposed architecture and extensive documentation.
This platform is based on Qt, OpenSceneGraph, Boost
and Eigen; optional dependencies include FBX, Draco,
CImg.

**Characteristics**:
C++, open-source, multi-plateform (Windows, Linux,
Mac OS X), compilation with CMake, quick and easy installation thanks to
extensive documentation.

**Rendering**: the GUI integrates several shaders such as Blinn-Phong and Cook-Torrance (for
physical based rendering). It can render both static (and dynamic) 3D
surface meshes, with color attributes, texture informations and normals or point clouds with color attributes and normals.

**Data structures**: MEPP is generic programming oriented. It offers
an abstraction layer that provides interoperability over several third party data structures: **OpenMesh**, **CGAL Surface Mesh**, **CGAL Polyhedral Surface**, **CGAL Linear Cell Complex**, **CGAL Point Set**, **PCL (Point Cloud Library)** and **AIF (Adjacency and Incidence Framework)**.


**Installation and developer documentation is [available here](http://liris.cnrs.fr/mepp/doc/nightly/)**.
