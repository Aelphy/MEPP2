@section FilterJNDDescriptionSection    Description

This filter implements the just noticeable distortion (JND) model recently proposed
by (Nader et al. 2016). This perceptually-driven model
integrates mathematical models of contrast sensitivity function and
contrast masking. It was calibrated using an experimental study of
the properties of the human visual system. It can predict, for a given
illumination and screen resolution, whether a change in local contrast
on a 3D mesh, induced by a local geometric distortion, is visible
or not.
