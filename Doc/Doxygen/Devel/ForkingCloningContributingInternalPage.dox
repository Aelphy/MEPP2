## Forking and cloning MEPP2 from GitLab

In order to become a MEPP2 contributor, you should be at ease with the following usages of [git (version control system)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)):
 - [git for beginners](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) (that refers to a [git install how-to](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) and also provides an interactive tutorial)
 - [Collaborating with git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing) (that mainly introduces the `git remote`, `git fetch`, `git push` and `git pull` commands)
 - Working within a [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow), that is the recommended workflow for MEPP2 (as opposed to using e.g. a [centralized workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow))

Then you can proceed with
 - [Connecting to your own gitlab account](https://gitlab.liris.cnrs.fr/). Then, ask by email (mepp@liris.cnrs.fr) to join the MEPP-team by giving your <tt>gitlab login name (important)</tt> in order to be able to see the MEPP2 repo. As long as a MEPP2 maintainer has not informed you that it is done, you will not be able to go further...
 For the rest of this inception description we shall assume that you signed in as `YourLogin`.
 - Once signed in, you should fork the [MEPP2 repository](https://gitlab.liris.cnrs.fr/MEPP-team/MEPP2) ([Gitlab](https://gitlab.liris.cnrs.fr/MEPP-team/MEPP2) web interface provides a single button method for this: look in the upper right section of the [MEPP2 repository](https://gitlab.liris.cnrs.fr/MEPP-team/MEPP2) home page)
 - Then in `Settings -> General -> Visibility, project features, permissions` (see the menu on the left) set `Pipelines` to OFF
 - On your desktop machine, you can now [(git) clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) your fork. When doing so on a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) you could use [something similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutatis_mutandis) to the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://gitlab.liris.cnrs.fr/YourLogin/MEPP2
  ```

## Contributing to MEPP2 on GitLab

To submit your own code for integration into the MEPP2 main repository, proceed
as usually in a [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow) \b except the last step (`Making a Pull Request`):
- commit your code to your local clone of MEPP2
- push your local commits to your fork of MEPP2 on Gitlab
- then push your branch (from your fork) to your MEPP2 master branch (i.e. `FLL-master`) on Gitlab (branch naming rule: first letter of your first name (\b F) and then first two letters of your last name (\b LL), example `bst-master` for Bjarne Stroustrup)
- open a Merge Request from your MEPP2 master branch (i.e. `FLL-master`) on Gitlab
- check the continuous integration (see `CI / CD -> Pipelines` menu on the left) results: if one build fail, fix the issue
  then try again until all builds pass without error
- when the continuous integration succeeds, a MEPP2 maintainer will integrate
  your code into the main repository.
