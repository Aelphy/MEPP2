## Forking and cloning MEPP2 from GitHub

In order to become a MEPP2 contributor, you should be at ease with the following usages of [git (version control system)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)):
 - [git for beginners](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) (that refers to a [git install how-to](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) and also provides an interactive tutorial)
 - [Collaborating with git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing) (that mainly introduces the `git remote`, `git fetch`, `git push` and `git pull` commands)
 - Working within a [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow), that is the recommended workflow for MEPP2 (as opposed to using e.g. a [centralized workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow))

Then you can proceed with
 - [Creating your own github account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) (if not already done). In doing so, please do choose a login that is unambiguous and straightforward to identify you: this will ease the burden of [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) tracking. For example use something like `FirstnameLastname` or `FirstnameLastnameOrganisationname` where the "Organisation Name" is the one you will be using while contributing code to MEPP2.
 For the rest of this inception description we shall assume that you signed in as `YourLogin`.
 - Once signed in, you should [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [MEPP2 repository](https://github.com/MEPP-team/MEPP2) ([Github](https://github.com/MEPP-team/MEPP2) web interface provides a single button method for this: look in the upper right section of the [MEPP2 repository](https://github.com/MEPP-team/MEPP2) home page)
 - On your desktop machine, you can now [(git) clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) your fork. When doing so on a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) you could use [something similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutatis_mutandis) to the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/YourLogin/MEPP2
  ```

## Contributing to MEPP2 on GitHub

To submit your own code for integration into the MEPP2 main repository, proceed
as usually in a [GitHub forking workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/):
- commit your code to your local clone of MEPP2
- push your local commits to your fork of MEPP2 on GitHub
- open a Pull Request from your fork of MEPP2 on GitHub
- check the continuous integration results: if one build fail, fix the issue
  then try again until all builds pass without error
- when the continuous integration succeeds, a MEPP2 maintainer will integrate
  your code into the main repository.
